------------

There are Voyagers and there are Gates. Gates are the games, which are broken up between the
"gate.sqlite" db and the "universe.sqlite" db. The gate file acts as the menu screen for character
selection, help info, and any other higher level information about the game. The universe file is
the actual game itself, in it's initial state (new game).

Once a Voyagers enters a Gate they are placed inside the Universe, this is done by creating a copy
of the universe file in their account folder, in a gate folder, named with the player name they
have provided. This new file acts as the save file for the player and is updated as the players
interacts with the universe (it auto-saves).

THIS HAS CHANGED
