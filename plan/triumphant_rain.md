Triumphant Rain
---

### Synopsis
    The game begins after the player has been pulled into the event horizon of a black hole. The
entire game plays out in less than a second that is stretched out to feel like an eternity by the
immense gravitational forces of the black hole.

    Without any memory of how you got here, you must navigate what appears to be a strange and
alien world, but in reality is merely your own subconcious mind grappling with unresolved events in
your past before you perish in the black hole.

    As you navigate and progress through the world you slowly recover lost memories from an event
in your past when as a teenager you accidentally got someone else killed in a car accident.
